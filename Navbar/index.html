      <h1>WHY THIS IS SO IMPORTANT</h1>
      <p>
        This stuff may sound cheesy and obvious when I spell it out like this,

        out loud every day: Be the one who goes out and does it. TODAY'S #ELB
        TASK LIST This is the definitely most vague and most important lesson,
        because only you can really think outside the box about what kind of
        skills you could speed up by yourself. 1. Go through the job
        descriptions you looked up during Lesson 1. Troll through the skill
        requirements and start breaking it down. How? Make a list in three
        columns: * the skills you definitely have * the skills kinda know but
        you could improve * the skills you don't know at all yet, but could
        potentially learn Focus on Column 2 first, so that you can move those
        skills into the "def have them" list. Then prioritise those skills you
        don't have yet and make a backlog, so that you can start slowly knocking
        them out over time. 2. Go through the LinkedIn employee profiles you
        looked up during Lesson 1. Look at the skills they highlight on their
        own profiles, and repeat the task above. 3. If you need a portfolio, or
        to prove you have the skills, figure out a way to demonstrate your
        expertise. That could be doing floral arrangements for a local charity
        event, sitting down every night for a week to write fake advertising
        slogans for Smirnoff Ice, or posting your in-progress illustrations on a
        website. (We'll talk about this concept of skillset hacking a ton more
        in the coming weeks–and, soon, you'll have access to a ton of examples
        in the book manuscript in order to spark more brainstorming.) Just know
        that any way you slice it, it's all in your hands. We can discuss these
        specifics and come up with a personal game plan for you during Call 1.
        Bring your ideas! I can't wait to hear what you come up with... Speak
        soon! []Lesson 1 Part 1 is about clarity. I want you to give yourself
        permission to slow down get super, super, super clear about what you
        want. Part 2 is about preparing for battle. Next up, I want you to give
        yourself permission to slow down and build all your collateral (resumes,
        cover letter templates, networking lists, LinkedIn, social, portfolio,
        etc) so that you have everything you need in order to make your job
        search a success. Part 3 is about going out into the world and
        introducing yourself to the right employers. I have many tricks up my
        sleeve. But that's next week's problem. First, we gotta give you a job
        search makeover... ....which brings us to today, your chance to get
        specific about your intentions! It's time for Lesson 1: Create A Game
        Plan Today we're focused on answering these two questions: Where are you
        actually trying to get hired? To do what? (If you didn’t have an
        immediate answer to that, that’s totally okay. A lot of times, we get so
        freaking panicked about getting hired by SOMEBODY ANYBODY ANYWHERE that
        we forget to ever specify what we’re looking for.) NAMING YOUR FUTURE
        EMPLOYER Note: If you're a more oratory learner, I've got a great audio
        lesson for you on this topic. Click here to download the materials from
        Dropbox. There's a worksheet in it for you to fill out, too. The first
        thing on our agenda is creating a target list of 10-15 employers. Just
        like when preparing for university applications back in high school, you
        need to know exactly where you’re applying before you put together an
        application. You wouldn't just apply to any Marketing course you saw,
        would you? You'd want to know where you were going to be studying.
        (Makes sense when I put it that way, doesn’t it?) This list is going to
        become your new holy scripture. It’s the place where you’re going to
        keep going back to, again, and again. Why? Because it’s the very best
        way to keep you from getting distracted. Think about it: you know that
        sending out resumes to every info@companyyoudontevenlike.com email
        address you can find is a waste of time. You know that most people get
        hired through that secret door. You do know this. And yet, like a bad
        job search junk food diet, we keep sending out those resumes anyways,
        don’t we? Because it makes us feel productive. And I don’t want you to
        simply feel productive. I want you to actually go accomplish things.
        WHERE TO START IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START If you cannot name one
        single company you want to work for today, that’s totally okay. You’re
        not alone–and it’s understandable. A lot of times, when we start
        tailspinning into the job search stress, having any kind of job starts
        looking less and less appealing. Every company on your target list
        should meet two major requirements. It should operate in an industry you
        want to work in and a city you plan to live in. INDUSTRY VS. DEPARTMENT
        See, there are two axes to consider when you're deciding where to head
        next in your career. But we tend to only think about one of them, and in
        very broad ways. "I want a job in marketing." "I want to do events." "I
        want to be a graphic designer." These are all departments and job titles
        within any given company. Vague, vague titles. Which is why focusing on
        which industry you want to work in is where the real secret lies. It can
        sound counterintuitive and scary to limit yourself to a specific
        industry, I know. But we're dealing with a little psychology here. You
        want to position yourself as a professional and an expert in your field.
        And most experts are very, very niche about what they do. Their
        specialization is what makes them so impressive and revered. To give an
        example, I want you to think about hiring a wedding photographer. You
        have two choices: 1. "I'm a photographer. Yeah, I shoot all kinds of
        events. It's not super expensive to hire me, either. Actually, if you
        hire me for two events at once, I'll give you $100 off right now." 2. "I
        focus on outdoor, mountain-landscape wedding photography for bohemian
        brides. Last year, I shot weddings in Sedona and Park City and
        Switzerland. I grew up in the mountains myself, and I don't think there
        is a more beautiful location in the world for a wedding. I really like
        to capture the entire weekend so that you don't have to worry about
        missing a single moment." Clearly, Option #2 is the dream choice. Not
        only do you know exactly what they love doing, you know how it is going
        to benefit you: the photographer's employer. They share your same
        vision.
